<title>Grandma's Savoury Pizza
<ingredients>
For the Pizza Dough:
2 cups all-purpose flour,
1 tsp instant yeast,
1/2 tsp salt,
1/2 cup warm water.
For the Pizza Toppings:
1 large thinly sliced onion,
3 cloves minced garlic,
2 tbsp olive oil,
1/2 cup chopped sundried tomatoes,
2 tbsp capers,
1 large sliced tomato,
1 cup vegan cheese.
<steps>
To make the pizza dough, combine the all-purpose flour, instant yeast, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Add the warm water and mix until a soft dough forms. Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for 5-7 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. Cover the dough with a clean kitchen towel and let it rest for 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 220Â°C.
In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the sliced onion and garlic, and cook for 10-15 minutes, or until the onions are caramelized and soft.
Roll out the pizza dough on a lightly floured surface to your desired thickness. Place the dough on a pizza pan or baking sheet.
Spread the caramelized onions and garlic over the pizza dough, leaving a small border around the edge. Sprinkle the chopped sundried tomatoes and capers over the top.
Add the sliced tomatoes and sprinkle the grated vegan cheese on top.
Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
Slice the pizza and serve hot. Enjoy the combination of savory caramelized onions, tangy sundried tomatoes, and salty capers, all topped with delicious vegan cheese on a homemade crust.
This vegan pizza is a perfect meal for a cozy night in, and it's easy to customize with your favorite toppings.
