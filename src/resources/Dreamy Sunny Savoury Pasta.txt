2 tomatoes, diced
1 cup vegan cheese, grated
2 tbsp all-purpose flour
1/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes, chopped
1 tbsp capers
Salt and pepper, to taste

<steps>	Cook the pasta according to the instructions on the package. Drain and set aside.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the onion is translucent. Add the diced tomatoes to the skillet and cook for another 3-4 minutes, or until the tomatoes have started to break down.
In a small bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour with 1/4 cup of water until smooth. Pour the mixture into the skillet and stir well.
Add the chopped sun-dried tomatoes and capers to the skillet and mix well. Let the mixture cook for another 2-3 minutes.
Stir in the grated vegan cheese and let it melt into the sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Add the cooked pasta to the skillet and toss it with the tomato and cheese sauce until well coated.
Serve the vegan tomato and cheese pasta hot, topped with extra grated vegan cheese, if desired.
