Party Cherries!
<ingredients>
1 cup fresh cherries, pitted
1/2 cup fresh pineapple, diced
8 oz dark chocolate, chopped

<steps>
Begin by washing and drying the cherries and pineapple. Remove the pits from the cherries and dice the pineapple into small pieces.
Melt the chopped dark chocolate in a double boiler or in the microwave, stirring frequently until it is fully melted and smooth.
Using a fork, dip each cherry and pineapple piece into the melted chocolate until it is fully coated. Place the coated pieces on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
Once all of the cherries and pineapple pieces are coated and arranged on the baking sheet, place the sheet in the refrigerator to allow the chocolate to cool and harden. This should take approximately 15-20 minutes.
Once the chocolate has hardened, remove the chocolate-covered cherries and pineapple from the refrigerator and transfer them to a serving dish. You can serve them as is, or garnish with additional melted chocolate, whipped cream, or chopped nuts.
These sweet and indulgent chocolate-covered cherries with a tropical twist of fresh pineapple are perfect as a treat or dessert, and are sure to satisfy any sweet cravings.
