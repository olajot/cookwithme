Stuffed bell peppers with crispy chickpeas and cilantro
<ingredients>
6 bell peppers, 4 cloves of garlic, 100g rice, pinch of salt, 1 tsp smoked paprika,
 1 handful chopped cilantro, 1 lemon, fresh ground pepper, 1 can chickpeas, olive oil, 150g plant-based mock beef, 1 can crushed tomatoes
<steps>
Wash and cook the rice. While it is cooking, prepare the chickpeas by crushing them with the back of a glass or with your hand,
then spread the chickpeas on a baking tray. Cut up the garlic, add salt and pepper and drizzle with olive oil. Bake at 180°C for 25-30 minutes.
 While it is baking, cut off the ends of the bell peppers (washing them thoroughly beforehand). Next, to a pan add the mock beef and seasonings,
 fry it for 3 minutes, pour in the tomatoes and add the rice. Stuff this mixture into the bell peppers, then bake them at 180°C for an hour.
  When done, top with juiced lemon, crispy chickpeas & the cilantro, and enjoy!
